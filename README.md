Mini Projects Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technologies

- Clustering Jobs

    Objective: To match potential job seekers with relevant job postings.
  
    Methodology: Employing K-means or DBSCAN clustering algorithms in conjunction with Word2vec or TF-IDF vectorization techniques to group similar job posts based on textual content.

- LSTM-Based Gold Price Prediction

    Objective: To forecast gold prices using a deep learning approach.

    Methodology: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with various hyperparameters to predict future gold prices based on historical data.
