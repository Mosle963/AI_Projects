Mini Projects Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technologies

- Clustering Jobs

    Objective: To match potential job seekers with relevant job postings.
  
    Methodology: Employing K-means or DBSCAN clustering algorithms in conjunction with Word2vec or TF-IDF vectorization techniques to group similar job posts based on textual content.

- LSTM-Based Gold Price Prediction

    Objective: To forecast gold prices using a deep learning approach.

    Methodology: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with various hyperparameters to predict future gold prices based on historical data.

- Detecting Fake News

    Objective: To accurately classify news articles as either fake or true using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

    Methodology: Employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forest Classifier, Passive Aggressive Classifier, and
                 Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, coupled with various embedding methods, to analyze the underlying context                  and word relationships within news articles and make informed classifications.
